title: Large Language Models
---

These models accept text input and produce text output (e.g., chat completions). They are primarily large language models (LLMs), some with mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures for scaling.

## Example launch Command

```shell Command
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \  # example HF/local path
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 30000 \
```

## Supported models

Below the supported models are summarized in a table.

If you are unsure if a specific architecture is implemented, you can search for it via GitHub. For example, to search for `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, use the expression:

```text Output
repo:sgl-project/sglang path:/^python\/sglang\/srt\/models\// Qwen3ForCausalLM
```

in the GitHub search bar.
