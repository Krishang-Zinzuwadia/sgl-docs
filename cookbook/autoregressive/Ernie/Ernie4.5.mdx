## 1. Model Introduction

The **ERNIE-4.5** series is a family of large language models developed by Baidu. ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration) 4.5 represents an advanced version of the ERNIE series, optimized for general-purpose tasks and conversational scenarios.

ERNIE-4.5 delivers advanced features as below:
- **Heterogeneous Modality Structure**: MoE architecture that supports parameter sharing across modalities while allowing dedicated parameters for each individual modality, enhancing multimodal understanding without compromising, and even improving, performance on text-related tasks.
- **Vision Encoder**: Dedicated adaptive-resolution ViT with 2D RoPE and image packing; for video, adaptive frame sampling and timestamp rendering, supporting both shared and modality-specific visual processing.
- **Adapter**: Shared modality-bridging module with spatial and temporal compression to align vision to text embedding space, enabling cross-modal understanding without compromising text representations.
- **Multimodal Position Embedding**: Unified 3D RoPE (temporal, height, width) for vision and 1D RoPE for text in a single embedding space, supporting parameter sharing while encoding modality-specific positions.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Specifically tuned for AMD MI300X, MI325X, and MI355X GPUs.

## 2. SGLang Installation

SGLang offers multiple installation methods. You can choose the most suitable installation method based on your hardware platform and requirements.

Please refer to the [official SGLang installation guide](https://docs.sglang.ai/get_started/install.html) for installation instructions.

## 3. Model Deployment

This section provides a progressive guide from quick deployment to performance optimization, suitable for users at different levels.
